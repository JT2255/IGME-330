I coded in TypeScript for this assignment. I changed all files to .ts and strongly typed all parameters and variable delcarations. I also created new external class files, as well as created interfaces and enums for use. There are no TypeScript errors present in any of the files. All special files are also organized in a folder for classes, a folder for enums, and a folder for interfaces.
